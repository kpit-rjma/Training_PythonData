# Training_PythonData
Creating a small console application for working with test data and visualization tools.
The purpose of the code is not to necessarily create a final project but to learn Python packages.
The packages used insofar include Numpy and MatPlotLib.

## Requirements
* Numpy, install from a prompt using: pip install numpy
* MatPlotLib, install from a prompt using: pip install matplotlib
* Data file from AndroSense--an Android app for tracking sensor data. This should be a CSV file.
* The AndroSense file should be located somewhere on the computer you are running the script from.
* Obtain the absolute path of this file, minding to replace "\" with "\\". You will need it in the Quick-Start.

## Quick-Start
* Enter code of MatPlotLib.py and change the file location to your own AndroSense data file.
* With Python installed and the PATH set up... run the following in the command line (ensure the current working directory contains the script):
python MatPlotLib.py
* Graphics should display, or follow the prompts to view data.

## Key Notes
* The code is VERY heavily documented for the benefit of the code reader
* Code review is the primary purpose of this project

## Further Development
* Implement additional algorithms
* Check for empty data
* Allow more inputs
* Allow user to choose a file from a file dialoge
